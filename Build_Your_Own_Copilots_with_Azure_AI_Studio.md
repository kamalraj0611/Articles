# Build your own copilots with Azure AI Studio

## Introduction

Powerful copilot experiences using GPT and other generative AI models are quickly becoming integral to modern applications. Microsoft now offers copilots across its popular services, from Bing to Microsoft 365 and GitHub, delivering intelligent interfaces that understand and respond naturally to user needs.

With **Azure AI Studio**, developers now have a unified platform to build and deploy custom copilots with advanced AI capabilities. In this article, we will explore how Azure AI Studio enables you to create, deploy, and monitor these copilotsâ€”all from one comprehensive platform.

## Overview of Azure AI Studio

Azure AI Studio provides access to a **Model Catalog** that includes models from Azure OpenAI Service, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft Research, and hundreds of open-source models. The platform also supports seamless integration with your data through **OneLake** in Microsoft Fabric, allowing you to bring in virtualized datasets without moving them.

Azure AI Studio is designed for the full **AI development lifecycle**:
- **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with prompt designs in the Playground.
- **Multi-modal Applications**: Incorporate text, images, video, and speech into applications.
- **Search Integration**: Use hybrid semantic search for precise information retrieval.
- **Evaluation and Safety**: Built-in tools ensure application quality and compliance with Responsible AI practices.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Copilot

1. **Accessing Azure AI Studio**: Start by visiting [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) and select "Build your own copilot" to create a new project or choose an existing one.
   
2. **Setting Up the AI Resource**: You can select an existing Azure AI resource or create a new one. The Playground interface will then provide a workspace for team collaboration.

3. **Deploying Models**: Choose from dozens of models available in the Azure Model Catalog. After deployment, navigate to the Playground, where you can experiment with prompts using the deployed model.

4. **Customizing System Messages**: Customize default system messages to add context to the copilot's responses. For instance, if you're building a **Food Recommendations Chatbot**, select specific messages for relevant, helpful responses.

5. **Data Integration for Grounding**: Ground your copilot by linking it to data sources. Azure AI Studio allows you to index and search your data using **Azure AI Search** and **OneLake**. By combining keyword and vector searches, Azure AI Studio provides accurate responses based on user intent.

6. **Testing with Prompts**: Use the Playground to refine prompts and review outputs. For example, asking "What is highest ratest food in the town?" returns relevant results like the "Idly, Dosa" thanks to retrieval-augmented generation.

7. **Multi-Modality Features**: Beyond text, Azure AI Studio supports multimedia data inputs. With **DALL-E 3** for image generation and **Azure AI Vision Video Retrieval**, you can add images and videos for a richer user experience.

8. **Advanced Prompt Flow**: For more control, use **Prompt Flow** to define step-by-step processes based on user prompts. This feature allows you to customize how prompts are processed, retrieved, and formatted.

9. **Evaluation Tools**: Use built-in tools to evaluate prompt flow performance. Compare prompt variations to enhance groundedness, relevance, and coherence, ensuring consistent output quality.

10. **Content Filters for Safety**: Apply **Azure AI Content Classifications** to set custom filters for harmful content, protecting both inputs and outputs.

11. **Deployment**: Deploy your copilot to an endpoint, then retrieve configuration code in your preferred language. This allows you to integrate the copilot into new or existing applications seamlessly.

12. **Fine-Tuning for Experts**: For advanced users, Azure AI Studio provides **model fine-tuning** options, enabling precise control over LLM behavior to meet specialized application needs.

## Conclusion

Azure AI Studio offers a powerful, unified platform to create, test, and deploy sophisticated generative AI applications. Whether you are building for text, image, or multi-modal use cases, Azure AI Studio provides all the tools you need for full-cycle AI development, from prompt design to deployment.
